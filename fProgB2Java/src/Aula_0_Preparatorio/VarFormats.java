        double num4 = 20.00; //double is just a better float. tbh dont even mind using float, just double

        char ch = 'A'; //just a character. dont forget to only use '' and not ""
        String str = "Hello World";// strings arent quite a var format. they work as strings just normally, but are actually a class in java.lang. like an extension.
        boolean bool = true; //true of false. that's it.
